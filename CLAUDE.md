# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Skin lesion image classification using a ResNet-152 backbone (PyTorch/torchvision). The codebase follows a modular ML pipeline pattern with separate concerns for data, model, and pipeline orchestration. Most source files are currently empty scaffolds awaiting implementation.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Common Commands

**Lint:**
```bash
ruff check src/ app/
ruff format src/ app/
```

**Run the Streamlit app:**
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit.py
```

**Run the FastAPI server:**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Organize raw HAM10000 (merge part_1/part_2 + by-class):**
```bash
python -m src.pipelines.data_preprocessing
```

## Code Style — PEP 8

All source files must comply with PEP 8. `ruff` is the enforcer; CI will fail on lint errors.

### Naming
- Modules and packages: `snake_case`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions and variables: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private helpers: prefix with a single underscore

### Docstrings
Every public function, method, and class must have a Google-style docstring. Every docstring must include `Args`, `Returns`, and `Raises` sections where applicable. Every parameter in `Args` must have a description, not just a type. The `Raises` section must list every exception the function can raise intentionally.

### Type Annotations
All function signatures must include type annotations for every parameter and the return type. Use `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of each file.

### Line Length
Maximum line length is 88 characters. Break long function signatures across multiple lines with one argument per line.

### File / Module Size
Keep each source file between 300 and 500 lines. If a file grows beyond 500 lines, split it into focused sub-modules and re-export the public API from the package `__init__.py`.

### Imports
Order imports in three blocks separated by a blank line: standard library, third-party packages, then internal project modules.

### Other Rules
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over raw string paths.
- Never use bare `except:`; always catch a specific exception type.
- Avoid mutable default arguments; use `None` and assign inside the function body.
- Use f-strings for string formatting; avoid `%` and `.format()`.

## FastAPI Best Practices

### Project Structure
Keep all API concerns inside `app/`. Organise into `routers/` (one file per domain), `schemas/` (separate files for request and response models), `dependencies.py` (shared `Depends()` providers), and `middleware.py` (CORS, logging, error handlers).

### Application Factory
Define the app via a `create_app()` factory function rather than a bare module-level instance. This keeps the app testable and configurable. Register all routers and middleware inside the factory.

### Pydantic Schemas
Define explicit Pydantic models for every request and response body; never use raw `dict`. Every field must have a type annotation and a `Field(description=...)` value so that the auto-generated OpenAPI docs are meaningful.

### Dependency Injection
Load heavy resources such as the model and label encoder once at startup using `Depends()` with `@lru_cache`. Never instantiate or load models inside a route handler.

### Route Handlers
Route handlers must be thin: validate input, call a service function from `src/`, and return a schema. Business logic must live in `src/`, not in `app/routers/`. Every route must declare a `summary`, `response_model`, and explicit `status_code`.

### Error Handling
Register a global exception handler in `middleware.py`. Do not wrap individual route handlers in try/except blocks for general errors.

### Async vs Sync
Use `async def` for I/O-bound routes. Use plain `def` for CPU-bound routes so FastAPI runs them in a thread pool. Never call blocking code directly inside an `async def` without offloading to an executor.

### Versioning
Prefix all routes with `/v1/` from day one. Add a `/v2/` router for breaking changes rather than modifying existing routes.

## Architecture

### `src/` — Core library
- **`src/data/loader.py`** — Dataset loading; wraps PyTorch `Dataset`/`DataLoader` for raw images from `data/raw/`
- **`src/data/encoder.py`** — Label encoding for skin lesion classes
- **`src/model/loader.py`** — Loads/instantiates ResNet-152; handles pretrained weights and checkpoint saving/loading
- **`src/model/train.py`** — Training loop (forward pass, loss, optimizer step)
- **`src/model/evaluation.py`** — Metrics computation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
- **`src/model/prediction.py`** — Inference on single images or batches
- **`src/utils.py`** — Shared utilities (device selection, path helpers)

### `src/pipelines/` — Orchestration scripts
- **`data_preprocessing.py`** — Reads `data/raw/`, applies transforms, writes to `data/processed/`
- **`model_training.py`** — Runs full training: data loading → model setup → train loop → checkpoint save
- **`model_evaluation.py`** — Loads a checkpoint and evaluates on a test split

### `app/`
- **`main.py`** — Application factory and entry point
- **`routers/`** — Route handlers grouped by domain
- **`schemas/`** — Pydantic request/response models
- **`dependencies.py`** — Shared `Depends()` providers (model, encoder)
- **`middleware.py`** — CORS, logging, global error handlers
- **`streamlit.py`** — Interactive demo; uploads an image and returns the predicted lesion class

### `data/`
- `data/raw/` — Original dataset (not tracked by git)
- `data/processed/` — Preprocessed/augmented data ready for training (not tracked by git)

### `notebooks/`
Jupyter notebooks for exploratory work; not part of the production pipeline.

🚨 Strict File Modification Policy

Claude must follow a strict single-file editing policy:

Only modify the file explicitly requested by the user.

Never modify, refactor, format, or “improve” any other file.

Never create new files unless the user explicitly asks to create them.

Never delete or rename files unless explicitly instructed.

If a requested change requires modifying another file, Claude must:

Stop.

Explain why another file would be affected.

Ask for explicit permission before proceeding.

Claude must treat all non-requested files as read-only.
